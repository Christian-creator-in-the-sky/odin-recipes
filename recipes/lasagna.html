    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>For a classic Italian lasagna, start by preparing the rich meat sauce. 
            In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat and sauté finely chopped onions, garlic, and a pinch of salt until softened. 
            Add ground beef (or a mixture of beef and pork for extra flavor) and cook until browned. 
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, a splash of red wine (optional), and a handful of fresh basil or dried oregano. 
            Simmer the sauce on low heat for at least 45 minutes to develop deep, rich flavors, then adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar if needed to balance the acidity.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, make the creamy ricotta filling by mixing ricotta cheese with egg, grated Parmesan, salt, pepper, and a handful of chopped fresh parsley. 
            Cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions, then drain and set aside. 
            To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, then layer noodles, ricotta mixture, more sauce, and shredded mozzarella cheese. 
            Repeat the layers, finishing with a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan on top. 
            Cover with foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes to brown the cheese. 
            Let it rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow the layers to set. Enjoy your perfect, cheesy, and hearty lasagna!</p>
