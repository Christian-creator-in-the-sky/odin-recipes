        <h2>Description</h2>
    
            <p>For a delicious Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich with Garlic Mayo, start by preparing the garlic mayo. 
                In a small bowl, mix together mayonnaise, minced garlic, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard (optional), then season with salt and pepper. 
                Set it aside in the fridge while you cook the steak. Thinly slice the ribeye (or sirloin) against the grain, 
                and sauté it in a hot skillet with a bit of olive oil or butter until browned and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes. 
                Remove the steak and set it aside. In the same pan, cook the sliced onions and optional bell peppers until caramelized and softened, 
                then return the steak to the pan and combine everything together.</p>
    
            <p>To assemble the sandwiches, spread a generous amount of garlic mayo on both sides of each hoagie roll. 
                Pile the steak mixture into the rolls, then top with provolone cheese (or American cheese for a more classic Philly version). 
                Toast the sandwiches under the broiler for a few minutes until the cheese melts and the rolls are golden. 
                Serve hot, sliced in half, and enjoy your perfectly balanced Philly Cheesesteak with creamy, flavorful garlic mayo!</p>
